Dear Hiring Manager,

This README provides an overview of the completed assignment and the challenges encountered during the process.

The project was built using Maven and includes the necessary dependencies Selenium, Java, Cucumber and JUnit.

The assignment was successfully executed to meet the primary requirement of reading the registration details and expected valuation. However, there were challenges along the way.

While using motor.co.uk, the website required email verification after entering the registration and confirming the mileage. Instead of displaying the information directly on the website, it sent a sign-in link to the provided email, complicating the automation process.

To work around this, I switched to confused.com, which initially functioned well for 2–3 attempts. However, the website likely detected the use of automation tools and began prompting for CAPTCHA verification, preventing further automated queries.

Given these challenges and the time constraints, I focused on meeting the core requirements of the assignment. With more time, I could have explored alternative approaches or implemented solutions to bypass these roadblocks more effectively.

Despite these limitations, I managed to fulfill most of the assignment’s objectives successfully.

Best regards,
Reena Dhiman
